## 🧠 About Me

I'm a dedicated and curious individual currently working in **technical support** — helping real customers solve real problems related to **fibre**, **ADSL**, **email**, and **landline** services through my role with **Telkom via Startek**. With hands-on experience troubleshooting internet connectivity, guiding users through router and ONT setups, and providing email configuration support, I’ve developed a strong foundation in communication and remote support.

But I’m not stopping there.  
My goal is to transition into **Cloud Engineering/Cloud Support**, where I can work on scalable infrastructure, automation, and secure systems that power the internet.
